# Hierarchical\_Matching\_model\_2022
Humans perform holistic hierarchical inference duringsensory perception (2022). 

## Dependencies
* Philipp Berens (2022). [Circular Statistics Toolbox (Directional Statistics)] (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10676-circular-statistics-toolbox-directional-statistics), MATLAB Central File Exchange. 
* We have included the function needed (const_vmpdf.m) and made a slight change to it, but would like to explicitly acknowledge the use of the package.

## Code Usage
Run demo.m to simulate the error distribution, bias and SD for a typical orientation estimation task, with noisy test stimulus and noiseless probe stimulus.
